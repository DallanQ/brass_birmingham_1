## Board Setup (Page 4)

1. Place the board on either the day or night side.
   
2. For a player count of less than 4, remove all cards and Merchant tiles that show a player count greater than your number of players, and return them to the box.

> The 2-player (2 avatar icons), 3-player (3 avatar icons), and 4-player (4 avatar icons) counts are shown in the bottom right corner on the front of the cards and along the top of the merchant tiles.

3. Separate the Wild Location and Wild Industry cards, and place them face up on 2 of the Card Draw Areas.

> Wild cards are the ones with white border. Categorize them based on their arts and put them in the 2 spaces of the Card Draw Areas excluding the one in the corner.

4. Shuffle the remaining cards and place them face down on the remaining Card Draw Area; this is the Draw Deck.

> The remaining Card Draw Area is the one in the corner.

5. Shuffle the remaining Merchant tiles, and place 1 (face up) on each of the Merchant spaces marked with the number of players in your game, located near the edges of the board.

Result: In a 2 player game, no Merchant tiles are placed in Warrington & Nottingham. In a 3-player game, no Merchant tiles are placed in Nottingham.

6. Place 1 beer barrel on each beer barrel space beside a (non-blank) Merchant tile.

7. Place 1 black cube on each space of the Coal Market, leaving 1 of the £1 spaces open.

> Leave the one with the dot in the bottom next to the number 1.

8. Place 1 orange cube on each space of the Iron Market , leaving both of the £1 spaces open.

> Leave the two in the bottom next to the number one, and beside the left one with the black cube.

9.  Place the remaining cubes and beer barrels beside the board; this is the General Supply.

Note: The General Supply is limitless. If you need more of a resource, represent it with something else.

10. Place the money beside the board; this is the Bank.

## Location Banners

In addition to helping players find locations on the board, the colours of the location banners also indicate which Location cards are in the Draw Deck. This varies with the player count:

- 2 players: blue and teal coloured Location cards are not in the Draw Deck.

- 3 players: teal coloured Location cards are not in the Draw Deck.

- 4 players: all Location cards are in the Draw Deck.

## Player Area Setup

1. Take a Player Mat.
2. Take £17 from the Bank
3. Choose a coloured Character tile.
4. Place the matching coloured Link tiles in your player area.
5. 
Place your Victory Point (VP) Marker on the "0" space of the Progress Track

.



Place your Income Marker on the "10" space of the Progress Track

.



.



Draw 8 cards from the Draw Deck; this is your Hand. Do not reveal your Hand to other players.



.

Draw 1 additional card from the Draw Deck and place it face down in your player area; this is your Discard Pile.

Stack the matching coloured Industry tiles (which consist of Cotton Mills Iron Works Potteries their appropriate slots on your Player Mat. The side of the tiles with the black top half should be face down.

- Afterwards, take all money from the Character tiles, and place it back into the Bank . This resets the money spent, ready for the next round.

## E

Take Income Take money from the Bank equal to your income level. Exception: Income is not collected at the end of the final round of the game.

- If you have a shortfall when paying negative income, you must acquire money by removing one or more of your Industry tiles (not Link tiles) from the board; each being worth half of its cost, rounded down. The removed tile is removed from the game. You keep any excess money.

## F

- Your income level is the number displayed on the coin beside your Income Marker's current location on the . Progress Track

## A

- If you have no way to pay a shortfall, lose 1 VP (if possible) for each £1 you are short.

Note: You may remove any of your Industry tiles, but must stop as soon as you have acquired enough money to cover the shortfall. You may not sell Industry tiles for any reason other than paying for a shortfall.

## Actions List

## The Goal

The game is played over 2 eras: the Canal Era (1770-1830) and the Rail Era (1830-1870). The winner is the player who has the most Victory Points (VPs) following the end of the Rail Era. VPs are scored at the end of each era for your Link tiles and flipped Industry tiles.

## Rounds

Each era is played in rounds, which continue until both the Draw Deck and players' Hands are exhausted. There are exactly 8/9/10 rounds per era in a 4/3/2-players game. During each round, players take turns in the order of their Character tiles on the Turn Order Track.

## Player Turns

On your turn, perform a total of 2 actions.

Exception: During the first round of the Canal Era, each player performs only 1 action.

- For each action you perform, you must discard a card from your Hand and place it face up on top of your Discard Pile. Exception: Wild cards are placed back onto their Card Draw Areas.

- After all of your actions have been completed, refill your Hand back up to 8 cards with cards from the Draw Deck.

- Place all money spent during your turn on top of your Character tile on the Turn Order Track.

- Once the Draw Deck has been

exhausted, your Hand will decrease each round until you have no cards left.

For each action, you may choose to perform one of the following (you may perform the same action twice):

## A

Passing - You may choose to pass instead of performing an action, but must still discard a card for each action you pass. Spending Money Any time you spend money to perform an action, you must place it on top of your Character tile Turn Order Track. Placing spent money here, rather than in the Bank, will allow you to determine the players' turn order for the next round.

## Consuming Beer

You may be required to consume beer when selling cotton, manufactured goods, or pottery; or when performing the Network action during the Rail Era. The amount required, if any, will be shown in the top right corner of the Industry tile.

## Consuming Iron

2

Iron is required to perform the Develop action, and to build certain Industry tiles.

## I

Beer may be consumed from any of the following sources: Your unflipped Breweries . These do not need to be connected to the location where the beer is required.

To consume iron, an Industry tile does not need a connection to a source of iron.

Iron must be consumed from: Any unflipped Iron Works (owned by any player); it does not have to be the closest. If you need more than 1 iron, you can consume each iron from a different Iron Works. Consuming iron in this way is free.

An opponent's unflipped Brewery . These must be connected to

the location where the beer is required.

The space beside a Merchant tile that you are selling to (see "Action - Sell").

If there are no unflipped Iron Works, you can purchase iron from the Iron Market , starting at the cheapest price. If the Iron Market is empty, you can still purchase iron for £6 /

When multiple beer barrels are required, each beer may be consumed from a different source.

.

Consumed iron cubes are placed back into the General Supply.

Consumed beer barrels are placed back into the General Supply.

Historical Note: These industries generally required iron in low volumes, so it could also be transported via horse and wagon.

Historical Note: Unpolluted drinking water was in short supply in expanding settlements, so beer was often the purest and safest drink available.

## Flipping Industry Tiles

## A

At the end of each era, flipped Industry tiles score VPs. When flipped, they have a black top half and a VP icon in the bottom left corner.

Different Industry tiles are flipped in different ways: • Cotton Mills,

Manufacturers, and Potteries: Flip when you perform a Sell action.

- Coal Mines, Iron Works, and Breweries: Flip when the last resource is removed from the tile. This often happens during an opponent's turn.

## Increasing Your Income

Whenever one of your Industry tiles is flipped your income is increased. To increase your income, immediately advance your Income Marker along the Progress Track

- The location contains one or more of ;

- The location is adjacent to one or more .

## Consuming Coal

Coal is required to build rail Links and certain Industry tiles.

To consume coal, a rail Link or Industry tile must be connected to a source of coal (after it is placed).

Coal must be consumed from:

The closest (fewest Link tiles distant) connected unflipped Coal Mine (owned by any player). If multiple Coal Mines are equally close, choose one. If a Coal Mine runs out of coal, and you need more, choose the next closest Coal Mine. Consuming coal in this way is free.

If you are not connected to an unflipped Coal Mine, you can purchase coal from the Coal Market , starting at the cheapest price.

This requires a connection to a icon (shown on the

Warrington, Shrewsbury, Nottingham, Gloucester, and Oxford Merchants around the edge of the board). If the Coal Market is empty, you can still purchase coal for £8 /

.

Consumed coal cubes are placed back into the General Supply.

Historical Note: Coal was required in large quantities, so a robust transportation network was critical.

## Build Action

Performing the Build action allows you to place Industry tiles onto a location on the board. To perform the Build action:

Discard an appropriate card. Unlike other actions, which allow you to use any card from your Hand, the Build action requires an appropriate card be discarded face up onto your Discard Pile:

Exception: Wild cards are placed back onto their Card Draw Area.

- Location card May be used to build any Industry tile at the location named on the card, even if the location is not a part of your network.

- Wild Location

card May be played as any Location card. This does not include the 2 Farm Breweries (see "Farm Breweries").

- An Industry card to build the matching Industry tile in any location with an undeveloped space displaying that industry's icon; • Any card to build a Link tile on any undeveloped line on the board.

## (Even Those Without

## Merchant Tiles); Or

- Iron Works, regardless of whether or not it is connected to a Merchant space:

You must immediately move as many cubes as possible from the Industry tile to available spaces in its associated Market (filling the most expensive spaces first).

Farm Breweries There are 2 unnamed locations, each with 1 space displaying a Brewery icon; these are Farm Breweries.

## P

For each cube moved, collect the corresponding amount of money displayed on the coin to the left side of its Market space

.

- You may only build in these locations using a Brewery Industry card or a Wild Industry card.

If the last cube is moved from your Industry tile to its Market, flip the Industry tile your Income Marker along the Progress Track by the number of spaces shown in the bottom right corner of the tile.

Kidderminster and Worcester also connects both locations to the Farm Brewery to their left. A second Link tile is not required; nor may it be placed there.

Note: In 2/3-player games you may still build in any location.

Take the lowest level tile chosen industry from your Player Mat and place it (the side with the black top half face down) on an undeveloped space in your chosen build location, obeying the following rules:

## Of The

- If possible, place it on a space displaying only that industry's icon .

- Otherwise, place it on a space displaying that industry's icon with another industry's icon .

- If no undeveloped spaces display your industry's icon, you may not place it in that location. Exception: (see "Overbuilding") The cost of the Industry tile you are building is displayed, to the left of its slot, on your Player Mat . Pay money onto your Character tile on the Turn Order Track, and consume any required iron and coal Remember: If coal is required, the location you are building in must be connected to a source of coal (see "Consuming Coal" and "Connected Locations").

Overbuilding Sometimes you are allowed to replace an already placed Industry tile with a higher- level tile of the same industry type (you must still pay the necessary build costs). This is known as Overbuilding. When Overbuilding:

Performing the Sell action allows you to flip built Cotton Mill, Manufacturer, and Pottery tiles. Selling requires:

- Connection to a Merchant tile. • Beer (usually).

If the tile you are replacing is your own

To perform the Sell action:

## Beginner Tips

- Do not be afraid of taking loans. Your income level at the end of the game is not worth VPs. It is not uncommon for experienced players to win the game despite having a low income level.

- Level 2 or greater Industry tiles are not removed at the end of the Canal Era, so could score twice if built early. A flipped level 3 Cotton Mill would score a whopping 18 VPs over both eras. The Develop action is your friend.

- Be careful when developing Breweries. Remember that beer is required to perform the Sell action, so having no access to beer that belongs to you can be devastating to your long-term strategy.

- Tiles with a

to the left of their slot on your Player Mat cannot be built during the Rail Era. Try to build or develop at least 1 Coal Mine and 1 Iron Works during the Canal Era, so that you do not have to use a Develop action during the Rail Era to clear these industries from your Player Mat.

- Figuring out how best to expand your network at the beginning of the Rail Era can be difficult for beginners. Expand your network by building rail Links to sources of coal. If you don't have access to any coal, build a Coal Mine.

Players then score additional points as follows:

Money Score 1 VP for every £4 in your player area (up to a maximum of 15 VPs). Income level Score VPs equal to your income level. If your income level is negative, you lose VPs.

Industry tiles Score the points a second time for all your level 2 or greater Industry tiles.

## Understanding Your Networks

## Things To Remember

- Discard 1 card for every single action you perform, including passing.

- Only Build actions need a specific card. • You can perform the same action twice in a turn. For instance, you may place 1 or 2 rail Links with the Network action, then use the Network action again to place 1 or 2 rail Links.

- During the Canal Era, each player may place a maximum of 1 of their Industry tiles in each location.

- You may Overbuild any of your Industry tiles without restriction. • You may also Overbuild opponents' Coal Mines/Iron Works, but only when there are no coal/iron cubes left on any Industry tiles or in the Market.

- You must be connected to a

## To

sell cotton, manufactured goods, or pottery; and to consume coal (but not iron) from the Market.

- You do not need to be connected to consume your own Breweries' beer, but must be connected to other players' Breweries, or to Merchant beer (only available when selling).

- A location must be a part of your network for you to build there (unless you use that specific Location card or a Wild Location card).

- Unlike the other level 1 Industry tiles, the level 1 Pottery tile may be built during the Rail Era.

## Introductory Game

Since Brass is such a deep game, some players may prefer to play a shorter introductory game for their first experience. The introductory game plays exactly like the full game, except you only play the Canal Era and there are additional scoring rules to make players' scores more closely reflect their success in the Canal Era.

To play the introductory game, first, play the entire Canal Era as normal, including the end of Canal Era scoring.

This diagram will help you better understand the concept of "your network" and the rules behind the Network action.

- The red tiles denote your link and industry tiles.

- The blue shades denote your network; as your network is a location that includes any of your industry tiles and any locations adjacent to one of your links. As you have a link from Birmingham to Redditch, Redditch is part of your network, even though you don't own an industry tile there.

- The yellow shades denote valid link placement as they are all rails adjacent to your network. • If you performed the Network action to build rail Link , it would be possible to build a second rail Link cost, and consume the necessary coal and beer). Note: You can expand over the board quickly by networking (placing links) and avoiding placing industry tiles.
