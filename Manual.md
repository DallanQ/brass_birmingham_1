I N D U S T R I A L R E V O L U T I O N

Sir Richard Arkwright (23 December 1732 – 3 August 1792) Taught to read and write by his cousin, Arkwright began as an apprentice barber, but after an early widowing his business ambitions grew, and his second marriage provided the funds to pursue wigmaking. When wigs fell out of fashion, he turned to textiles and made improvements on the spinning jenny with the clockmaker John Kay. Taking his business to the small village of Cromford, Arkwright encouraged weavers with large families to move there and work in his mill, including children as young as seven. Arkwright pioneered the use of the steam engine with textile machinery, a precursor to Edmund Cartwright's development of the power loom. In his later years, after an extended court battle, Arkwright lost many of his patents and his domination of the textile industry, but shortly after this he was knighted. Ambitious, religiously devout, and at times difficult to work with, Arkwright's ingenuity and organizational skills would make him known as the "father of the modern industrial factory system."

Eliza Tinsley (17 January 1813 – 17 January 1882) Following the death of her husband Thomas and his father, along with the death of her eldest of six children, Tinsley continued both her late husband and her late father-in-law's businesses in the Black Country as one under her own name. The Eliza Tinsley company produced nails for horseshoes, and chains and anchors for ships, the latter of which would become the focus as motor vehicles replaced horses. Chainmaking was a particularly male-dominated industry, but Tinsley excelled, employing around 4000 workers, and she established an offshoot company in Australia. Many of Tinsley's employees were women and young girls, and she fought against government efforts to restrict women, and girls under 14, from working in the nail and chainmaking industries, arguing that "the conditions of both trades are favourable to moral and physical health." Known as "The Widow," Tinsley was respected for her industry expertise. She sold the company at 58, but it would continue operating under her name into the 21st century.

Isambard Kingdom Brunel (9 April 1806 – 15 September 1859) At the age of 15, Brunel's father Marc was sent to a debtors' prison, but his debts were paid by the British government when he made it known that the Tsar had offered him a position as an engineer in Russia. Brunel studied in France under the clockmaker Abraham Louis Breguet. Upon returning to England he became an assistant on Marc's project to create a tunnel under the Thames, but a nearly-fatal flooding incident put the 22-year-old out of commission for several months. This didn't stop Brunel from becoming one of the most prolific engineers in history, creating tunnels, bridges, railways, a portable hospital, and a vacuum-powered 'atmospheric railway', though unfortunately for the latter the leather flaps sealing the vacuum pipes were eaten by rats. His 'Great Western' was the first steamship to conduct transatlantic service, and his 'Great Eastern' was the largest ship ever built up to that time, but Brunel died of a stroke at 53 just before her maiden voyage. Brunel is known today as an engineering giant.

George Stephenson (9 June 1781 – 12 August 1848) After the death of his wife and daughter, the 25-year-old Stephenson, having no formal education, left for Scotland to find work but returned to West Moor when his father was blinded in a mining accident. When he offered to improve the mine's deficient pumping engine, Stephenson was made enginewright and became an expert in steam-engine technology. His Northumberland accent made him unpopular with the scientific community, and when he presented his design for a safer mining lamp that would not cause explosions, the Royal Society accused him of stealing the concept from parallel-inventor Humphry Davy. But Stephenson's big claim to fame was his contribution to rail transport, and the invigoration of the rail industry. At age 40 he began work on the first public railway, and his locomotive known as 'Stephenson's Rocket' won a competition by achieving the record speed of 36 miles per hour, which led some to fear that such speeds would cause women's uteruses to literally fly out of their bodies. Thankfully this did not occur.

H I S T O R I C A L F I G U R E S

James Watt (30 January 1736 – 25 August 1819) Tinkering with models and ship's instruments at his father's workbench from an early age, Watt left for Glasgow at 17 to learn to make measuring instruments such as scales and compasses, and befriended the chemist Joseph Black. In his 30s, while repairing a model of the Newcomen steam engine used widely for pumping water out of mines, Watt noticed that the design wasted energy on cooling and reheating the cylinder, and he improved upon it by adding a separate condenser which would revolutionize the steam engine. However he was unable to make progress on this venture for several years as he was busy at his day job surveying Scottish canals. This changed when English manufacturer Matthew Boulton took an interest in his patent, and Watt moved to Birmingham to form a partnership that would last 25 years and spread his improved steam engine across the world of industry. Though a somewhat feeble businessman on his own (Watt once said he "would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain"), he was greatly respected by his peers, and the basic unit of power, the "watt," bears his name.

Robert Owen (14 May 1771 – 17 November 1858) Falling in love with Caroline Dale, daughter to the owner of the New Lanark mill co-founded by Richard Arkwright, Owen convinced his business partners to purchase the mill. He ran it with great success, but displeased his partners with egalitarian activities such as paying wages to his workers over a four month period in which the mills were closed during the War of 1812. An avid scholar, Owen became critical of prevailing religious thought on human self-determinism, and he developed his own philosophy that one's circumstances are largely the result of external forces, and that therefore education and philanthropy should be paramount in society. He undertook a variety of social reform projects such as lobbying for workers and children's rights and for an 8-hour work day, and temporarily left Britain to found a socialist commune in America called New Harmony. The experiment was an economic failure that bankrupted Owen, but it did produce one of the first public libraries and a free school open to both boys and girls, and his philosophies are deeply woven into socialist movements within the United States.

Sir Henry Bessemer (19 January 1813 – 15 March 1898) Like Isambard Kingdom Brunel's father, Bessemer's father Anthony was forced to flee France during the French Revolution. Anthony had become a member of the Académie des sciences at 26 for his improvements on the optical microscope, and made his fortune in Britain with a process for making gold chains. Bessemer's first innovation mirrored his father's affinity for gold. After carefully analyzing bronze powder from Nuremberg, used in the manufacture of gold paint, he reverse engineered the process and created a series of six steam-powered machines that could manufacture the powder. He later developed a cheap system of creating steel by blowing air through molten pig iron to burn off impurities. The goal was initially to reduce the cost of military ordnance, but this technique of affordable steel revolutionized structural engineering and made bridges and railroad tracks, previously reliant on wrought and cast iron, much safer. Bessemer pioneered over 100 inventions in the fields of metalworking and glass, including a steamship cabin on gimbals intended to stay level to prevent seasickness which was sadly lost at sea, and he gained considerable commercial success leveraging his innovations.

Eleanor Coade (3 June 1733 – 16 November 1821) Bringing her up a devout Baptist, Coade's parents were both successful merchants. Her grandmother Sarah Enchmarch had run the family textile business in Tiverton with 200 employees, using spies to acquire new manufacturing techniques, and was known for travelling around town in a sedan chair. After Coade's family moved to London, she ran her own linen draper business at age 30. Six years later she purchased an artificial stone business from the struggling Daniel Pincot, but fired him within two years for "representing himself as the chief proprietor." Her ceramic stoneware called "Coade's Lithodipyra" went on to be used in over 700 sculptures across the globe, many of them overseen by the sculptor John Bacon, though she worked with a number of high-profile designers and architects as it allowed her to produce multiple copies of their designs. The South Bank Lion may be Coade's most iconic piece, but her product was also used for the Gothic screen of St George's Chapel, and in the restoration of Buckingham Palace.

## Actions List

## The Goal

The game is played over 2 eras: the Canal Era (1770-1830) and the Rail Era (1830-1870). The winner is the player who has the most Victory Points (VPs) following the end of the Rail Era. VPs are scored at the end of each era for your Link tiles and flipped Industry tiles.

## Rounds

Each era is played in rounds, which continue until both the Draw Deck and players' Hands are exhausted. There are exactly 8/9/10 rounds per era in a 4/3/2-players game. During each round, players take turns in the order of their Character tiles on the Turn Order Track.

## Player Turns

On your turn, perform a total of 2 actions.

Exception: During the first round of the Canal Era, each player performs only 1 action.

- For each action you perform, you must discard a card from your Hand and place it face up on top of your Discard Pile. Exception: Wild cards are placed back onto their Card Draw Areas.

- After all of your actions have been completed, refill your Hand back up to 8 cards with cards from the Draw Deck.

- Place all money spent during your turn on top of your Character tile on the Turn Order Track.

- Once the Draw Deck has been

exhausted, your Hand will decrease each round until you have no cards left.

For each action, you may choose to perform one of the following (you may perform the same action twice):

## A

Passing - You may choose to pass instead of performing an action, but must still discard a card for each action you pass. Spending Money Any time you spend money to perform an action, you must place it on top of your Character tile Turn Order Track. Placing spent money here, rather than in the Bank, will allow you to determine the players' turn order for the next round.

Iron is required to perform the Develop action, and to build certain Industry tiles.

## I

Beer may be consumed from any of the following sources: Your unflipped Breweries . These do not need to be connected to the location where the beer is required.

To consume iron, an Industry tile does not need a connection to a source of iron.

Iron must be consumed from: Any unflipped Iron Works (owned by any player); it does not have to be the closest. If you need more than 1 iron, you can consume each iron from a different Iron Works. Consuming iron in this way is free.

An opponent's unflipped Brewery . These must be connected to

the location where the beer is required.

The space beside a Merchant tile that you are selling to (see "Action - Sell").

If there are no unflipped Iron Works, you can purchase iron from the Iron Market , starting at the cheapest price. If the Iron Market is empty, you can still purchase iron for £6 /

When multiple beer barrels are required, each beer may be consumed from a different source.

.

Consumed iron cubes are placed back into the General Supply.

Consumed beer barrels are placed back into the General Supply.

Historical Note: These industries generally required iron in low volumes, so it could also be transported via horse and wagon.

Historical Note: Unpolluted drinking water was in short supply in expanding settlements, so beer was often the purest and safest drink available.

## Flipping Industry Tiles

## A

At the end of each era, flipped Industry tiles score VPs. When flipped, they have a black top half and a VP icon in the bottom left corner.

Different Industry tiles are flipped in different ways: • Cotton Mills,

Manufacturers, and Potteries: Flip when you perform a Sell action.

- Coal Mines, Iron Works, and Breweries: Flip when the last resource is removed from the tile. This often happens during an opponent's turn.

## Increasing Your Income

Whenever one of your Industry tiles is flipped your income is increased. To increase your income, immediately advance your Income Marker along the Progress Track

## Consuming Coal

Coal is required to build rail Links and certain Industry tiles.

To consume coal, a rail Link or Industry tile must be connected to a source of coal (after it is placed).

Coal must be consumed from:

The closest (fewest Link tiles distant) connected unflipped Coal Mine (owned by any player). If multiple Coal Mines are equally close, choose one. If a Coal Mine runs out of coal, and you need more, choose the next closest Coal Mine. Consuming coal in this way is free.

If you are not connected to an unflipped Coal Mine, you can purchase coal from the Coal Market , starting at the cheapest price.

This requires a connection to a icon (shown on the

Warrington, Shrewsbury, Nottingham, Gloucester, and Oxford Merchants around the edge of the board). If the Coal Market is empty, you can still purchase coal for £8 /

.

Consumed coal cubes are placed back into the General Supply.

Historical Note: Coal was required in large quantities, so a robust transportation network was critical.

## Build Action

Performing the Build action allows you to place Industry tiles onto a location on the board. To perform the Build action:

Discard an appropriate card. Unlike other actions, which allow you to use any card from your Hand, the Build action requires an appropriate card be discarded face up onto your Discard Pile:

Exception: Wild cards are placed back onto their Card Draw Area.

- Location card May be used to build any Industry tile at the location named on the card, even if the location is not a part of your network.

- Wild Location

card May be played as any Location card. This does not include the 2 Farm Breweries (see "Farm Breweries").

Discard any card from your Hand, and place it face up onto your Discard Pile. Exception: Wild cards are placed back onto their Card Draw Area.

Take £30 from the bank, and move your Income Marker 3 income levels (not spaces) backwards down the Progress Track . Place your Income

Marker on the highest space within the new lower income level. Exception: You cannot take a loan if it will take your income level below -10.

## Scout Action

1

Performing the Scout action allows you to acquire Wild cards, which provide increased flexibility in where you may build. The Wild Industry card can be played as any Industry card. The Wild Location card can be played as any Location card. When discarded, a Wild card is placed back onto its Card Draw Area, not onto your Discard Pile. To perform the Scout action:

2

Discard any card from your Hand, plus 2 additional cards and place them face up onte your Discard Pile.

## Network Action

Performing the Network action allows you to place Link tiles, which expand your network and gain you access to new locations.

## Beginner Tips

- Do not be afraid of taking loans. Your income level at the end of the game is not worth VPs. It is not uncommon for experienced players to win the game despite having a low income level.

- Level 2 or greater Industry tiles are not removed at the end of the Canal Era, so could score twice if built early. A flipped level 3 Cotton Mill would score a whopping 18 VPs over both eras. The Develop action is your friend.

- Be careful when developing Breweries. Remember that beer is required to perform the Sell action, so having no access to beer that belongs to you can be devastating to your long-term strategy.

- Tiles with a

to the left of their slot on your Player Mat cannot be built during the Rail Era. Try to build or develop at least 1 Coal Mine and 1 Iron Works during the Canal Era, so that you do not have to use a Develop action during the Rail Era to clear these industries from your Player Mat.

- Figuring out how best to expand your network at the beginning of the Rail Era can be difficult for beginners. Expand your network by building rail Links to sources of coal. If you don't have access to any coal, build a Coal Mine.

Players then score additional points as follows:

Money Score 1 VP for every £4 in your player area (up to a maximum of 15 VPs). Income level Score VPs equal to your income level. If your income level is negative, you lose VPs.

Industry tiles Score the points a second time for all your level 2 or greater Industry tiles.

## Understanding Your Networks

## Things To Remember

- Discard 1 card for every single action you perform, including passing.

- Only Build actions need a specific card. • You can perform the same action twice in a turn. For instance, you may place 1 or 2 rail Links with the Network action, then use the Network action again to place 1 or 2 rail Links.

- During the Canal Era, each player may place a maximum of 1 of their Industry tiles in each location.

- You may Overbuild any of your Industry tiles without restriction. • You may also Overbuild opponents' Coal Mines/Iron Works, but only when there are no coal/iron cubes left on any Industry tiles or in the Market.

- You must be connected to a

## To

sell cotton, manufactured goods, or pottery; and to consume coal (but not iron) from the Market.

- You do not need to be connected to consume your own Breweries' beer, but must be connected to other players' Breweries, or to Merchant beer (only available when selling).

- A location must be a part of your network for you to build there (unless you use that specific Location card or a Wild Location card).

- Unlike the other level 1 Industry tiles, the level 1 Pottery tile may be built during the Rail Era.

## Introductory Game

Since Brass is such a deep game, some players may prefer to play a shorter introductory game for their first experience. The introductory game plays exactly like the full game, except you only play the Canal Era and there are additional scoring rules to make players' scores more closely reflect their success in the Canal Era.

To play the introductory game, first, play the entire Canal Era as normal, including the end of Canal Era scoring.

This diagram will help you better understand the concept of "your network" and the rules behind the Network action.

- The red tiles denote your link and industry tiles.

- The blue shades denote your network; as your network is a location that includes any of your industry tiles and any locations adjacent to one of your links. As you have a link from Birmingham to Redditch, Redditch is part of your network, even though you don't own an industry tile there.

- The yellow shades denote valid link placement as they are all rails adjacent to your network. • If you performed the Network action to build rail Link , it would be possible to build a second rail Link cost, and consume the necessary coal and beer). Note: You can expand over the board quickly by networking (placing links) and avoiding placing industry tiles.
